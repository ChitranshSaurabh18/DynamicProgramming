# DynamicProgramming
This project contains solutions to various DP problems that are commonly asked in coding challenges/interviews.
The link to the problem description is provided in the comments section of each class.

The problems solved are as following:
  1.  Binomial Coefficients
  2.  Maximum sum of a contiguous sequence
  3.  Maximum subsequence sum with no consecutive elements in the subsequence
  4.  Maximum subsequence sum with no three adjacent elements in the subsequence
  5.  Minimum number of jumps to reach the last element
  6.  Longest Increasing Subsequence
  7.  Longest Subsequence where difference between adjacent elements is 0, +1 or -1
  8.  Longest Zigzag Subsequence length
  9.  Minimum Cost Path
  10. Number of subsequences in a string divisible by K
  11. Ugly Numbers
  12. Number of ways to write n as sum of 1, 3 and 4
  13. Subset Sum
  14. Partition array into two subsets with equal sum
  15. Minimum coin change
  16. Weighted Interval Scheduling
  17. Tie Tiling (2 x n rectangle)
